# Evaluation Metrics and Clinical Considerations for Medical LLMs

- Accuracy and F1 score are commonly used but insufficient alone for clinical decision-making.
- Calibration is critical in healthcare settings to ensure confidence scores reflect true likelihoods.
- Hallucination risk remains a major concern, especially in open-ended clinical question answering.
- Medical LLMs may generate fluent but incorrect responses, necessitating human-in-the-loop validation.
- Domain-specific fine-tuning improves performance but may reduce generalizability.
- Benchmark datasets often lack real-world clinical noise and edge cases.
- Explainability is essential for clinician trust, yet many high-performing models remain opaque.
- Safety evaluation should consider potential downstream harm from incorrect recommendations.
- Clinical deployment requires alignment with regulatory and ethical standards.
- Evaluation frameworks should balance raw performance with reliability, robustness, and interpretability.
