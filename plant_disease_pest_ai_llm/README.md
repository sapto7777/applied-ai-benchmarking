# Plant Disease & Pest Detection using Deep Learning and AI-LLM-Assisted Systems
This module provides benchmarking tables and evaluation notes for plant disease and pest detection systems based on deep learning, with additional discussion on emerging AI and LLM-assisted pipelines for agricultural intelligence.

## AI and LLM-Assisted Plant Health Systems

While the core evaluations focus on vision-based deep learning models (CNNs, Transformers), recent agricultural AI systems increasingly integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) for:

- Automated diagnosis explanation from vision outputs
- Farmer-facing decision support and recommendations
- Multimodal reasoning over images, weather, and soil data
- Knowledge-grounded advisory systems for crop management

This repository includes notes on how benchmarked vision models can be integrated into such AI-LLM-assisted pipelines.
This work is frequently cited in the context of both vision-based plant disease detection and emerging AI/LLM-assisted agricultural decision support systems.

ABSTRACT = {Addressing plant diseases and pests is not just crucial; it’s a matter of utmost importance for enhancing crop production and preventing economic losses. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning have revolutionised the precision and efficiency of this process, surpassing the limitations of manual identification. This study comprehensively reviews modern computer-based techniques, including recent advances in artificial intelligence, for detecting diseases and pests through images. This paper uniquely categorises methodologies into hyperspectral imaging, non-visualisation techniques, visualisation approaches, modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models, helping researchers gain detailed, insightful understandings. The exhaustive survey of recent works and comparative studies in this domain guides researchers in selecting appropriate and advanced state-of-the-art methods for plant disease and pest detection. Additionally, this paper highlights the consistent superiority of modern AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Further, this survey focuses on the efficiency of vision transformers against well-known deep learning architectures like MobileNetV3, which shows that Hierarchical Vision Transformer (HvT) can achieve accuracy upwards of 99.3% in plant disease detection. The study concludes by addressing the challenges of designing the systems, proposing potential solutions, and outlining directions for future research in this field.},
